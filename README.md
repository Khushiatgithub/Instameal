#Instameal

InstaMeal is a smart and intuitive mobile app that helps you instantly discover what you can cook using just the ingredients you have at home. Powered by a machine learning model, the app predicts suitable recipes based on your input, making it easy to plan meals without the guesswork.

Whether you’re low on groceries, trying to reduce food waste, or simply unsure what to cook, InstaMeal has you covered. Just enter a list of ingredients like "egg, tomato, onion" — and let InstaMeal suggest a dish you can make right away!
